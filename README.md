## 🎯 The Story

It's 11 PM. Your CBSE Chemistry practical is tomorrow at 9 AM. You've got three crumpled sheets of notes, a half-memorized titration procedure, and absolutely no idea which salt test is which.

**Sound familiar?**

I built this website in a panic-driven coding session because:
- Traditional notes are overwhelming
- YouTube tutorials are 45 minutes long
- Textbooks have everything *except* what you actually need
- My ADHD brain needed bite-sized, actionable steps

So I made something different.
